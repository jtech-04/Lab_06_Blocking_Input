/*
user for a measurement in meters and then converts it to miles, feet, and inches. Again, check for valid input and exit with an error msg if you donâ€™t get it. LET IT REPEAT You can look up the conversion formulas with the Web
trick- how to know if you have miles or not(might not have enough)
steps:
1. first ask for the number/ prompt them
2. then convert the number into: miles, feet, and inches at the same time
3. create else's that will make it invalid and force them to go again
4. know how much for it to be miles(can't I do just decimals?)
